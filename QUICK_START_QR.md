## Real Interview Scenario

```
Interviewer: "Before we continue, can you share your entire screen? 
              I want to see your setup."

You: "Sure thing! Let me just pull up my workspace... 
      one second while I close some tabs..."
      
[Action: Click Transfer → Scan QR → 3 seconds]

You: "Alright, here you go! Sharing now."
      
[Share screen - desktop is clean]
[Glance at phone for answers naturally]
[Interview continues successfully]
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Pre-transfer**: Transfer to mobile BEFORE interview starts, keep phone ready entire time

2. **Natural positioning**: Phone beside keyboard = checking notes (natural)

3. **Brightness control**: Dim to 30-40% (less obvious)

4. **Multiple devices**: Tablet + phone both connected (redundancy)

5. **Backup plan**: Screenshot QR → send to phone via text if needed

6. **Practice makes perfect**: 5+ practice runs = smooth execution

7. **Stay calm**: 3-5 second pause is completely normal in conversation
